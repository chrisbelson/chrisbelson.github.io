## 📝 Implementation Note
This portfolio intentionally uses a single HTML file with embedded CSS for several technical reasons:
- Optimized performance (single HTTP request)
- Simplified deployment and maintenance
- Reduced build complexity
- Reliable GitHub Pages compatibility
- Zero external dependencies

While this approach might seem unconventional, it's a deliberate choice for this specific use case, prioritizing reliability and simplicity over component modularity.
